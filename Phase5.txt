Contributions: 

Eduardo: Updated processor schematic to include 5 stage pipeline, hazard unit, static branch prediction, and EX-EX/MEM-EX forwarding. Implemented IF/ID, ID/EX, and MEM/WB pipeline in heart.v. Debugged hazard and stalling logic issues. Implemented forwarding module and connected in heart.v also debugged any integration issues with forwarding to pass tests. 

Vedaant: worked on hazard unit logic, implementation and debugging. Logic of stalls, transitioning from working with combinational data memory/instruction memory to timed/sequential memory. Worked on debugging via waveforms and generated outputs. 
Synthesized the netlist.
